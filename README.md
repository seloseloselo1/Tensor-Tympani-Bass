this is the first reveal of my internal sound making manual, a work that will come in a series, fully open and publicly available on github, licensed under a free license. this project is an exploration of sound, particularly the vibrations within our own bodies, and how we can understand and control them. it is not merely a technical guide but a deep inquiry into the biopolitical implications of self-control and pleasure.

in this manual, i will explore how individuals can voluntarily manipulate their bodies for the sake of pleasure, within the larger context of biopolitics. this includes exploring the tensor tympani muscle, a small muscle in the ear that typically functions reflexively, tightening the eardrum in response to loud sounds. while normally involuntary, research and practice suggest that with training, it may be possible to gain voluntary control over this muscle, allowing us to consciously regulate the intensity of sounds we hear and even control the body’s response to them.

this exploration isn’t just about personal self-exploration—it’s a critique of how our bodies have been governed historically, and how we can reclaim autonomy over them in new and intimate ways.

you are encouraged to use these techniques for your own exploration and pleasure, understanding how sound and control can be applied to your body. this isn’t simply a project of self-improvement; it's about reclaiming the body’s power and control over its own sensations. the manual will continuously unfold in a series, but it will always remain freely accessible on github, open for anyone to engage with, contribute to, or critique.

this work challenges how we relate to our bodies, how we navigate pleasure, and how the politics surrounding our bodies shape these experiences.
